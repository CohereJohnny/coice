- **Configuration**: Ensured consistent Cohere client configuration across all services
- **Status**: Ready for embedding generation testing and content processing

#### [Date] - Root Cause Analysis and Embedding Generation Infrastructure
- **Issue Identified**: Search returns no results because **zero embeddings exist** for 104 images and 622 other content items
- **Database Analysis**: Confirmed all content tables (catalogs: 5, libraries: 6, images: 104, job_results: 507) have NULL embeddings
- **Search UX Fix**: Implemented debounced search (500ms) with request cancellation to prevent page lockups during typing

#### [Date] - Critical Database Schema Fix - Embedding Dimension Mismatch
- **Root Cause Identified**: Existing embeddings in database had ~12,700 dimensions, but Cohere V4 generates 1024 dimensions
- **Dimension Mismatch**: Query embeddings (1024) vs stored embeddings (~12,700) caused cosine similarity calculations to fail
- **Solution Applied**: 
  - Used Supabase MCP server to drop all existing embedding columns 
  - Recreated embedding columns with proper `vector(1024)` constraint
  - Ensured schema enforcement for exactly 1024 dimensions
  - Verified all tables (catalogs, libraries, images, job_results) have correct vector(1024) type

#### [Date] - Fixed Bulk Image Deletion UX Issue with Sonner Confirmations
- **User Problem**: JavaScript alerts popping up for every single image during bulk deletion
- **Issue Identified**: Poor UX caused by:
  - Bulk delete asking for confirmation once with `confirm()`
  - Then calling individual `handleDeleteImage` for each image
  - Each individual call showing another `confirm()` dialog
  - Multiple interruptions for user during bulk operations
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - **Sonner Integration**: Replaced all JavaScript `confirm()` calls with Sonner toast confirmations

- **User Experience Improvements**:
  - **No Interruptions**: Single confirmation for bulk operations
  - **Clear Progress**: Visual feedback during multi-image deletion
  - **Informative Results**: "Deleted 5 images, failed to delete 2 images" type messaging
  - **Consistent Interface**: All confirmations use the same Sonner toast pattern
- **Status**: Bulk deletion now provides smooth, uninterrupted UX with proper confirmation flow

- Implement proper search ranking using vector similarity + text relevance

### Search Architecture - Enhanced with Cohere V4
- Use hybrid search: Cohere V4 embeddings for semantic similarity + PostgreSQL full-text for exact matches
- Implement multimodal search: text queries can find similar images and vice versa
- Add embedding generation pipeline for new content
- Consider implementing embedding caching for frequently accessed content

### Cohere V4 Integration Details
- Model: `embed-v4.0` (supports both text and images)
- Input types: `search_query` and `search_document`
- Image format: Base64 data URLs
- Embedding dimensions: 1024
- Batch processing for efficient API usage

### Performance Targets - Updated
- Search response time < 500ms for most queries (including embedding similarity)
- Support for searching across 10,000+ images with embeddings
- Autocomplete suggestions within 200ms
- Embedding generation < 2s per image
- Vector similarity search < 100ms

### User Experience Goals - Enhanced
- Intuitive search interface with semantic similarity
- Visual similarity search for images
- Clear visual hierarchy for different content types  
- Efficient filtering workflow for narrowing results
