## Sprint Review

### Demo Readiness:
âœ… **Fully functional foundation** - The Coice application now has:
- Professional-looking interface with Coice branding
- Responsive navigation (navbar + sidebar)
- Dashboard with placeholder data and quick actions
- All major dependencies installed and configured
- Development and build processes working perfectly

### Key Features Working:
