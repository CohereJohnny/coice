3. Test dark mode toggle functionality (if implemented)
4. Check that custom theme configuration is applied
**Expected Result:** Tailwind CSS classes are processed and applied correctly

### TC-007: Basic Layout Rendering
**Objective:** Verify basic layout components render correctly
**Steps:**
1. Load the main page
2. Verify Navbar component is visible
3. Check Sidebar component is rendered
4. Test responsive layout on different screen sizes
5. Verify layout doesn't break on mobile devices
**Expected Result:** All layout components render without errors

### TC-008: File Structure Compliance
**Objective:** Verify project structure matches specifications
**Steps:**
1. Compare actual file structure with filestructure.md
2. Check that all required directories exist
3. Verify API route placeholders are in correct locations
4. Confirm component directory structure
**Expected Result:** File structure matches specification exactly

### TC-009: Environment Configuration
**Objective:** Verify environment setup is correct
**Steps:**
1. Check .env.example contains all required variables
2. Verify .env.local structure is documented
3. Test that environment variables are properly loaded
4. Confirm sensitive files are in .gitignore
**Expected Result:** Environment configuration is complete and secure

### TC-010: Git Repository Setup
**Objective:** Verify Git repository is properly configured
**Steps:**
1. Check .gitignore excludes appropriate files
2. Verify initial commit includes all necessary files
3. Test that sensitive files are not tracked
4. Confirm branch structure is correct
**Expected Result:** Git repository is properly configured and secure

## Performance Tests

### PT-001: Build Performance
**Objective:** Verify build process completes in reasonable time
**Steps:**
1. Run `pnpm build` and measure time
2. Check bundle size is reasonable for initial setup
3. Verify no performance warnings
**Expected Result:** Build completes in under 30 seconds

### PT-002: Development Server Performance
**Objective:** Verify development server starts quickly
**Steps:**
1. Measure time from `pnpm dev` to server ready
2. Test hot reload speed
3. Check memory usage is reasonable
**Expected Result:** Server starts in under 10 seconds

## Security Tests

### ST-001: Environment Security
**Objective:** Verify sensitive information is not exposed
**Steps:**
1. Check that .env files are in .gitignore
2. Verify no API keys or secrets in committed code
3. Test that environment variables are properly scoped
**Expected Result:** No sensitive information is exposed

### ST-002: Dependency Security
**Objective:** Verify dependencies don't have known vulnerabilities
**Steps:**
1. Run `pnpm audit`
2. Check for high-severity vulnerabilities
3. Verify all dependencies are from trusted sources
**Expected Result:** No high-severity vulnerabilities found
