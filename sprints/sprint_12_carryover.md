# Sprint 12 Carryover Tasks

## Overview
This document tracks incomplete tasks from Sprint 12 that need to be carried forward to the remaining sprints before v1.0.0 release.

**Total Incomplete Tasks from Sprint 12**: 22

## Task Distribution for Remaining Sprints

### Sprint 13: Admin Panel & User Management (2 weeks)
**Focus**: User management, access control, and infrastructure dependencies

#### Database Schema & Infrastructure (6 tasks)
- [ ] Add tag-based filtering for images (requires tags table/schema)
- [ ] Add user/creator filtering (requires user tracking infrastructure)
- [ ] Create embedding update triggers for content changes
- [ ] Add tag filter interface in search UI
- [ ] Add job completion time sorting for job results
- [ ] Implement user activity tracking for search/content access

**Rationale**: These tasks require database schema changes and user tracking infrastructure that align with Sprint 13's admin and user management focus.

### Sprint 14: Performance Optimization & Polish (2 weeks)
**Focus**: Performance improvements, mobile responsiveness, and UI polish

#### Performance Optimization (2 tasks)
- [ ] Implement embedding caching for frequently accessed content
- [ ] Add result thumbnail previews optimization

#### Mobile Responsiveness (4 tasks)
- [ ] Mobile-optimized search input
- [ ] Collapsible filters on mobile
- [ ] Touch-friendly result cards
- [ ] Swipe gestures for result navigation

**Rationale**: These tasks directly align with Sprint 14's performance and polish goals.

### Sprint 15: Testing, Documentation & Deployment (2 weeks)
**Focus**: Comprehensive testing, documentation, and production readiness

#### Testing Suite (6 tasks)
- [ ] Unit tests for search API endpoints
- [ ] Integration tests for search components
- [ ] Performance testing with large datasets
- [ ] User acceptance testing for search UX
- [ ] Embedding generation and similarity testing
- [ ] Search performance benchmarking

**Rationale**: All testing tasks naturally belong in the final testing sprint.

## Task Analysis

### Dependencies Identified
1. **Tag System**: Multiple tasks depend on a tagging infrastructure that doesn't exist yet
2. **User Tracking**: User/creator filtering requires tracking who uploaded/created content
3. **Mobile Framework**: Mobile gestures may require additional libraries or framework setup

### Complexity Assessment
- **High Complexity**: Tag system implementation, embedding update triggers
- **Medium Complexity**: Mobile responsiveness, caching system
- **Low Complexity**: Sorting additions, UI tweaks

### Recommendations
1. **Sprint 13**: Focus on building the foundational infrastructure (tags, user tracking) before implementing dependent features
2. **Sprint 14**: Prioritize mobile responsiveness as it impacts the most users
3. **Sprint 15**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all search functionality

## Notes
- The task "Enhanced multimodal search using Cohere V4 embeddings" appears incomplete but was actually implemented based on the progress log
- Some tasks may be deprioritized if they're not critical for v1.0.0 release
- Consider creating a post-v1.0.0 backlog for nice-to-have features
