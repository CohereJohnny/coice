# Sprint 6 Tasks

## Goals
Implement Card and List view components for image browsing with metadata display

### Key Deliverables:
- Card view with thumbnail grid and hover effects
- List view using TanStack Table with sortable columns

- [ ] Implement hover effects and image preview overlays
- [ ] Add image selection functionality (checkboxes)
- [ ] Create metadata overlay on hover (filename, size, date)
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for thumbnails
- [ ] Add loading skeleton states for card grid

### 2. List View Implementation
- [ ] Set up TanStack Table for List view
- [ ] Define table columns (thumbnail, filename, size, date, dimensions, etc.)
- [ ] Implement sortable columns for all metadata fields
- [ ] Add row selection functionality
- [ ] Create custom cell renderers for thumbnails and metadata
- [ ] Implement table pagination for large image sets
- [ ] Add column visibility controls
- [ ] Style table with proper spacing and hover states

### 3. View Switching & Controls
- [ ] Create ViewSwitcher component (Card/List toggle)
- [ ] Implement view state persistence in URL params
- [ ] Add view-specific controls (grid size for Card, columns for List)
- [ ] Create toolbar with view controls and bulk actions
- [ ] Add search/filter input for images
- [ ] Implement sort controls for Card view
- [ ] Add items per page selector

### 4. Image Metadata Enhancement
- [ ] Enhance metadata extraction to include more EXIF data
- [ ] Add image dimensions and color space information
- [ ] Implement metadata caching for performance
- [ ] Create metadata display components (tooltips, panels)
- [ ] Add metadata search and filtering capabilities
- [ ] Implement metadata editing functionality
- [ ] Add bulk metadata operations

### 5. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for large image sets
- [ ] Add progressive image loading with blur-up effect
- [ ] Optimize thumbnail generation and caching
- [ ] Implement image preloading for better UX
- [ ] Add intersection observer for lazy loading
- [ ] Optimize re-renders with proper memoization
- [ ] Add error boundaries for image loading failures

### 6. Responsive Design & Mobile
- [ ] Ensure Card view works well on mobile devices
- [ ] Implement touch-friendly interactions
- [ ] Add swipe gestures for mobile navigation
- [ ] Optimize List view for mobile (horizontal scroll)
- [ ] Implement responsive breakpoints for grid columns
- [ ] Add mobile-specific view controls
- [ ] Test and optimize performance on mobile devices

### 7. Integration & Testing
- [ ] Integrate Card/List views into LibraryDetailClient
- [ ] Update library page to use new view components
- [ ] Add proper error handling for image loading
- [ ] Implement loading states throughout the views
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation support
- [ ] Test with various image formats and sizes
- [ ] Verify accessibility compliance (ARIA labels, focus management)

### 8. UI Polish & Animations
- [ ] Add smooth transitions between view modes
- [ ] Implement hover animations and micro-interactions
- [ ] Add loading animations for thumbnails
- [ ] Create consistent spacing and typography
- [ ] Add proper focus states for keyboard navigation
- [ ] Implement selection animations and feedback
- [ ] Polish overall visual design and consistency

## Progress Notes

### Implementation Status
- Starting Sprint 6 with foundation from Sprint 5
- GCS integration and image upload functionality completed
- Basic image storage and retrieval working
- Ready to implement viewing components

### Technical Considerations
- Need to leverage existing thumbnail generation from lib/thumbnail.ts
- Should integrate with existing image metadata from lib/image-utils.ts
- Must work with current GCS signed URL system
- Should maintain consistency with existing UI components
