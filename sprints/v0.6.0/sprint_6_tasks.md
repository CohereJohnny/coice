# Sprint 6 Tasks

## Goals
Implement Card and List view components for image browsing with metadata display

### Key Deliverables:
- Card view with thumbnail grid and hover effects
- List view using TanStack Table with sortable columns
- Image metadata display (EXIF, file info)
- View switching functionality
- Responsive image loading and optimization

## Tasks

### 1. Card View Implementation
- [x] Create CardView component with thumbnail grid layout
- [x] Implement responsive grid system (auto-fit columns)
- [x] Add image thumbnail display with proper aspect ratios
- [x] Implement hover effects and image preview overlays
- [x] Add image selection functionality (checkboxes)
- [x] Create metadata overlay on hover (filename, size, date)
- [x] Implement lazy loading for thumbnails
- [x] Add loading skeleton states for card grid

### 2. List View Implementation
- [x] Set up TanStack Table for List view
- [x] Define table columns (thumbnail, filename, size, date, dimensions, etc.)
- [x] Implement sortable columns for all metadata fields
- [x] Add row selection functionality
- [x] Create custom cell renderers for thumbnails and metadata
- [x] Implement table pagination for large image sets
- [x] Add column visibility controls
- [x] Style table with proper spacing and hover states

### 3. View Switching & Controls
- [x] Create ViewSwitcher component (Card/List toggle)
- [ ] Implement view state persistence in URL params
- [x] Add view-specific controls (grid size for Card, columns for List)
- [x] Create toolbar with view controls and bulk actions
- [x] Add search/filter input for images
- [x] Implement sort controls for Card view
- [x] Add items per page selector

### 4. Image Metadata Enhancement
- [ ] Enhance metadata extraction to include more EXIF data
- [ ] Add image dimensions and color space information
- [ ] Implement metadata caching for performance
- [ ] Create metadata display components (tooltips, panels)
- [ ] Add metadata search and filtering capabilities
- [ ] Implement metadata editing functionality
- [ ] Add bulk metadata operations

### 5. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for large image sets
- [ ] Add progressive image loading with blur-up effect
- [ ] Optimize thumbnail generation and caching
- [ ] Implement image preloading for better UX
- [x] Add intersection observer for lazy loading
- [ ] Optimize re-renders with proper memoization
- [ ] Add error boundaries for image loading failures

### 6. Responsive Design & Mobile
- [x] Ensure Card view works well on mobile devices
- [x] Implement touch-friendly interactions
- [ ] Add swipe gestures for mobile navigation
- [x] Optimize List view for mobile (horizontal scroll)
- [x] Implement responsive breakpoints for grid columns
- [x] Add mobile-specific view controls
- [ ] Test and optimize performance on mobile devices

### 7. Integration & Testing
- [x] Integrate Card/List views into LibraryDetailClient
- [x] Update library page to use new view components
- [x] Add proper error handling for image loading
- [x] Implement loading states throughout the views
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation support
- [ ] Test with various image formats and sizes
- [ ] Verify accessibility compliance (ARIA labels, focus management)

### 8. UI Polish & Animations
- [x] Add smooth transitions between view modes
- [x] Implement hover animations and micro-interactions
- [x] Add loading animations for thumbnails
- [x] Create consistent spacing and typography
- [ ] Add proper focus states for keyboard navigation
- [x] Implement selection animations and feedback
- [x] Polish overall visual design and consistency

## Progress Notes

### Implementation Status
- ✅ **Core Components Created**: CardView, ListView, ViewSwitcher all implemented
- ✅ **UI Dependencies**: Created Checkbox, Table, DropdownMenu components
- ✅ **Integration Complete**: LibraryDetailClient fully refactored to use new components
- ✅ **Basic Functionality**: View switching, image selection, sorting, filtering all working
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Grid layouts adapt to screen size, mobile-friendly controls
- ✅ **Bulk Operations**: Download/delete multiple images implemented

### Technical Achievements
- **CardView**: Responsive grid with 3 size options, hover effects, metadata overlays
- **ListView**: TanStack Table with sortable columns, pagination, search functionality
- **ViewSwitcher**: Comprehensive toolbar with all view controls and bulk actions
- **Selection System**: Multi-select with Ctrl/Cmd, range select with Shift
- **Error Handling**: Graceful image loading failures, empty states
- **Performance**: Lazy loading, loading skeletons, optimized re-renders

### Next Steps
- [ ] URL state persistence for view preferences
- [ ] Enhanced EXIF metadata extraction and display
- [ ] Virtual scrolling for very large image sets
- [ ] Keyboard navigation and accessibility improvements
- [ ] Mobile gesture support (swipe navigation)
- [ ] Performance testing with large datasets

### Technical Considerations
- ✅ Leveraged existing thumbnail generation from lib/thumbnail.ts
- ✅ Integrated with existing image metadata from lib/image-utils.ts
- ✅ Works with current GCS signed URL system
- ✅ Maintains consistency with existing UI components
- ✅ TypeScript types properly defined for all components
