## Architecture Highlights

### Database Design
```sql
-- 14 interconnected tables with proper relationships
profiles -> catalogs -> libraries -> images
prompts -> pipelines -> pipeline_stages -> jobs -> job_results
groups -> user_groups, library_groups, catalog_groups
feature_flags (admin configuration)
```

### Authentication Flow
```typescript
// Multi-provider authentication with state persistence
User Registration/Login -> Profile Creation -> Role Assignment -> 
Route Protection -> State Persistence -> Session Management
```

### Component Architecture
```
AuthProvider (Context)
├── AuthGuard (Route Protection)
├── LoginForm (Authentication)
├── RegisterForm (User Creation)
├── Navbar (Auth-Aware Navigation)
└── Protected Pages (Role-Based Access)
```

## Security Implementation

### Row Level Security Policies
- **Profiles**: Users can view/edit own profile, admins can manage all
- **Catalogs**: Role-based access with group permissions
- **Libraries**: Nested permissions with parent-child relationships
- **Images**: Library-based access with metadata protection
- **Jobs**: Creator and library-based access control
- **Admin Tables**: Strict admin-only access for groups and feature flags

### Authentication Security
- **Password Requirements**: Minimum 6 characters with validation
- **OAuth Integration**: Secure Google OAuth with proper redirect handling
- **Session Management**: Automatic token refresh and cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without sensitive data exposure
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in Supabase rate limiting for auth endpoints

## User Experience

### Authentication Flows
- **Registration**: Smooth signup with email verification
- **Login**: Fast authentication with remember me functionality
- **OAuth**: One-click Google authentication with proper error handling
- **Logout**: Clean session termination with state cleanup
- **Protected Routes**: Seamless redirects for unauthenticated users

### UI/UX Features
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with proper breakpoints
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback for all async operations
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Theme Support**: Foundation for light/dark theme switching

## Testing & Validation
