# Sprint 8 Tasks: Prompt & Pipeline Management

## Goals
Implement prompt creation, pipeline definition, and multi-stage workflow configuration

## Key Deliverables
- Prompt creation and management interface
- Pipeline builder with multi-stage support
- Prompt types (boolean, descriptive, keywords)
- Stage ordering and conditional filtering
- Pipeline templates and reusability

## Tasks

### Database Schema & API Foundation
- [x] Review and validate prompt/pipeline database schema
- [x] Create prompt management API routes (CRUD operations)
- [x] Create pipeline management API routes (CRUD operations)
- [x] Implement prompt type validation (boolean, descriptive, keywords)
- [x] Add API endpoints for pipeline templates

**Progress Notes:**
- ✅ Database schema already implemented in Sprint 2 - validated prompts and pipelines tables with proper relationships
- ✅ Created comprehensive prompt API routes:
  - GET /api/prompts - List prompts with filtering, pagination, and search
  - POST /api/prompts - Create new prompts (Manager/Admin only)
  - GET /api/prompts/[id] - Get specific prompt details
  - PUT /api/prompts/[id] - Update prompts (Creator/Admin only)
  - DELETE /api/prompts/[id] - Delete prompts with usage validation
- ✅ Created comprehensive pipeline API routes:
  - GET /api/pipelines - List pipelines with filtering and library association
  - POST /api/pipelines - Create pipelines with multi-stage support
  - GET /api/pipelines/[id] - Get pipeline details with stages
  - PUT /api/pipelines/[id] - Update pipelines and stages
  - DELETE /api/pipelines/[id] - Delete pipelines with job usage validation
- ✅ Implemented full prompt type validation for boolean, descriptive, and keywords types
- ✅ Pipeline templates functionality integrated into pipeline API routes (save/load capability)
