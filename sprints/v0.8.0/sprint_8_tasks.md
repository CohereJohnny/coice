# Sprint 8 Tasks: Prompt & Pipeline Management

## Goals
Implement prompt creation, pipeline definition, and multi-stage workflow configuration

## Key Deliverables
- Prompt creation and management interface
- Pipeline builder with multi-stage support
- Prompt types (boolean, descriptive, keywords)
- Stage ordering and conditional filtering
- Pipeline templates and reusability

## Tasks

### Database Schema & API Foundation
- [x] Review and validate prompt/pipeline database schema
- [x] Create prompt management API routes (CRUD operations)
- [x] Create pipeline management API routes (CRUD operations)
- [x] Implement prompt type validation (boolean, descriptive, keywords)
- [x] Add API endpoints for pipeline templates

**Progress Notes:**
- ✅ Database schema already implemented in Sprint 2 - validated prompts and pipelines tables with proper relationships
- ✅ Created comprehensive prompt API routes:
  - GET /api/prompts - List prompts with filtering, pagination, and search
  - POST /api/prompts - Create new prompts (Manager/Admin only)
  - GET /api/prompts/[id] - Get specific prompt details
  - PUT /api/prompts/[id] - Update prompts (Creator/Admin only)
  - DELETE /api/prompts/[id] - Delete prompts with usage validation
- ✅ Created comprehensive pipeline API routes:
  - GET /api/pipelines - List pipelines with filtering and library association
  - POST /api/pipelines - Create pipelines with multi-stage support
  - GET /api/pipelines/[id] - Get pipeline details with stages
  - PUT /api/pipelines/[id] - Update pipelines and stages
  - DELETE /api/pipelines/[id] - Delete pipelines with job usage validation
- ✅ Implemented full prompt type validation for boolean, descriptive, and keywords types
- ✅ Pipeline templates functionality integrated into pipeline API routes (save/load capability)

### Prompt Management System
- [x] Create prompt creation/editing form component
- [x] Implement prompt type-specific form fields and validation
- [x] Build prompt listing interface with search and filtering
- [x] Add prompt preview/testing functionality
- [ ] Implement prompt versioning system
- [ ] Create prompt export/import functionality

**Progress Notes:**
- ✅ Created comprehensive PromptForm component with:
  - Type-specific form fields for boolean, descriptive, keywords prompt types
  - Built-in examples and preview functionality
  - Comprehensive validation and character limits (100 chars name, 2000 chars prompt)
  - Responsive design with proper error handling
- ✅ Created PromptList component with:
  - Search and filtering by prompt type
  - Sortable columns (name, type, created date)
  - Pagination support (10 items per page)
  - Role-based action permissions (view, edit, delete, copy)
  - Responsive grid layout with dropdown actions
- ✅ Created PromptViewer component with:
  - Detailed prompt display with type information
  - Usage preview showing expected input/output formats
  - Copy functionality and technical details
  - Role-based edit/delete actions
- ✅ Created PromptManager orchestration component with:
  - State management for different view modes (list, create, edit, view)
  - Role-based permission checks (admin/manager can create, creators can edit own)
  - Integrated CRUD operations with API endpoints
  - Error handling and user feedback

### Pipeline Builder Interface
- [ ] Design and implement pipeline builder UI
- [ ] Create drag-and-drop stage ordering interface
- [ ] Implement stage configuration forms
- [ ] Add conditional filtering and branching logic
- [ ] Build pipeline visualization/flowchart view
- [ ] Create pipeline validation and error checking

### Pipeline Templates & Reusability
- [ ] Implement pipeline template creation system
- [ ] Build template library with categorization
- [ ] Add template import/export functionality
- [ ] Create template sharing and community features
- [ ] Implement pipeline cloning and modification

### Integration & Testing
- [ ] Integrate prompt/pipeline management with existing catalog system
- [ ] Add pipeline execution preview/dry-run functionality
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Create unit tests for prompt/pipeline components
- [ ] Add integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Test pipeline builder with complex multi-stage scenarios

### UI/UX Polish
- [ ] Ensure responsive design across all components
- [ ] Add loading states and progress indicators
- [ ] Implement toast notifications for user actions
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for power users
- [ ] Create contextual help and documentation
