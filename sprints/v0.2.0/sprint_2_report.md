# Sprint 2 Report

## Overview
Sprint 2 focused on Supabase integration, authentication, and database schema for the Coice platform. The sprint delivered a robust authentication system, secure RLS policies, and a production-ready foundation for future sprints.

## Goals
- Set up Supabase backend and configure environment
- Implement complete database schema (14 tables)
- Establish comprehensive RLS policies for all tables
- Build authentication system with role-based access (admin, manager, end_user)
- Implement user profile management and protected routes
- Ensure persistent, secure auth state management

## Key Achievements
- **Supabase Project**: Fully configured with Auth, PostgreSQL, and Real-time
- **Database Schema**: All 14 tables implemented with proper relationships and constraints
- **RLS Policies**: Multi-tenant, role-based access control for all tables
- **Authentication**: Email/password and Google OAuth (with feature flag)
- **Profile Management**: Automatic profile creation, update, and role assignment
- **Protected Routes**: AuthGuard and role-based UI navigation
- **State Management**: Zustand store with persistence and robust initialization
- **UI/UX**: Responsive, accessible auth flows and error handling
- **Build Quality**: Zero ESLint/TypeScript errors, optimized bundle, production-ready

## Sprint Review
- **Demo Readiness**: Auth system is fully functional and demo-ready. Users can register, login, and access protected content based on role.
- **Security**: RLS policies prevent unauthorized access. No infinite recursion or policy errors remain.
- **Performance**: Fast auth operations, optimized bundle size, and smooth UX.
- **Code Quality**: Strict linting, type safety, and modular architecture.
- **Documentation**: All tasks, progress, and review notes tracked in sprint_2_tasks.md.

## Gaps/Issues
- Google OAuth is feature-flagged and can be enabled after further configuration.
- Admin-only profile access is not implemented at the RLS level (by design, for safety).
- All critical bugs and blockers were resolved during the sprint.

## Next Steps
- Begin Sprint 3: Core Navigation & Layout
- Implement enhanced sidebar navigation and responsive layout
- Add theme switching and advanced search foundation

## Completion Status
**Sprint 2 is 100% complete.**
- All planned tasks delivered
- No critical bugs or blockers remain
- Ready for next sprint
