- ✅ Email/password and Google OAuth authentication
- ✅ Role-based access control (admin, manager, end_user)
- ✅ Protected routes and auth-aware UI
- ✅ Persistent auth state management
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and validation
- ✅ Production-ready build with zero errors

## Sprint Review

### Demo Readiness
The application now has a complete authentication system that is ready for demonstration:
- Users can register and login with email/password or Google OAuth
- Role-based access control is enforced throughout the application
- Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to login
- Auth state persists across browser sessions
- UI is fully responsive and accessible

### Technical Quality
- **Code Quality**: All code passes ESLint and TypeScript strict checks
- **Performance**: Optimized bundle size with proper code splitting
- **Security**: Comprehensive RLS policies protect data access
- **Maintainability**: Well-structured components with proper separation of concerns
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive task tracking and progress notes

### Next Steps for Sprint 3
The foundation is now complete for Sprint 3: Core Navigation & Layout. Key areas to focus on:
1. Enhanced sidebar navigation with catalog/library tree structure
2. Responsive layout improvements for mobile devices
3. Theme switching implementation
4. Advanced search functionality
5. User preference management

### Lessons Learned
- Supabase SSR package provides better Next.js integration than deprecated auth helpers
- Comprehensive RLS policies are essential for multi-tenant security
- TypeScript strict mode catches many potential runtime errors
- Zustand provides excellent state management with minimal boilerplate
- shadcn/ui component patterns create consistent, accessible UI components
