## Progress Notes

### Completed Tasks (Day 1)
- **Database Schema**: Complete implementation of all 14 tables with proper relationships, indexes, and constraints
- **RLS Policies**: Comprehensive Row Level Security policies implemented for all tables with role-based access control
- **Supabase Client**: Updated to use @supabase/ssr package for proper SSR support
- **Authentication Store**: Zustand store with persistence for auth state management
- **Auth Provider**: Context provider for managing auth state across the application
- **API Routes**: Login, registration, logout, and callback routes implemented
- **Profile API**: GET and PUT endpoints for user profile management
- **UI Components**: Created Button, Input, Label, and Card components with proper TypeScript types
