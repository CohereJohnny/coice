## Prompt Edit/Delete Functionality

**Added**: Sprint 8  
**Priority**: High  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 0.5-1 sprint  

### Description
Implement comprehensive edit and delete functionality for prompts with proper permissions and safety checks:
- Edit prompt name, content, and type
- Delete prompts with dependency checking
- Permission-based access control
- Toast notifications using Sonner
- Real-time list refresh after operations

### Technical Considerations

- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and user feedback

### User Stories
- As a prompt creator, I want to edit my prompts to improve their effectiveness
- As a prompt creator, I want to delete prompts I no longer need
- As a manager, I want to edit any prompt to maintain quality standards
- As a user, I want to be warned if I try to delete a prompt that's being used by pipelines
- As a user, I want immediate feedback when operations succeed or fail

### Implementation Tasks
1. Add edit/delete buttons to prompt list actions dropdown
2. Create prompt edit form (reuse/extend existing PromptForm)
3. Implement PUT endpoint for prompt updates
4. Implement DELETE endpoint with dependency checking
5. Add refresh mechanism to PromptList component
6. Integrate Sonner toast notifications
7. Add permission checks in UI and API
8. Handle type conversion issues (similar to pipeline fixes)

### Dependencies
- Prompt management system (✅ completed in Sprint 8)
- User permission system (✅ available)
- Pipeline system (✅ completed in Sprint 8) - for dependency checking
- Sonner integration (✅ available)

### Notes
- Follow the same patterns established in pipeline management for consistency
- Ensure proper error handling and user feedback
- Consider impact on pipeline integrity when editing prompts

## Prompt Versioning System

**Added**: Sprint 8  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Complexity**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 sprints  

### Description
Implement a comprehensive versioning system for prompts that allows users to:
- Track changes to prompts over time
- Revert to previous versions
- Compare different versions
- Maintain audit trails for prompt evolution

### Technical Considerations
- **Database Schema**: Need to design version storage (separate table vs. JSON history)
- **UI/UX Design**: Version comparison interface, rollback workflows, version navigation
- **Performance**: How to handle large version histories efficiently
- **Storage**: Optimization for storing multiple versions without excessive storage growth
- **Permissions**: Who can create versions, rollback, etc.
- **Pipeline Impact**: How versioning affects existing pipelines using those prompts

### User Stories
- As a prompt creator, I want to see the history of changes I've made to a prompt
- As a manager, I want to rollback a prompt to a previous version if the current one isn't working
- As an analyst, I want to compare two versions of a prompt to understand what changed
- As an admin, I want to see who made changes and when for audit purposes

### Dependencies
- Prompt management system (✅ completed in Sprint 8)
- User permission system (✅ available)
- Pipeline system integration (✅ completed in Sprint 8)

### Notes
This feature requires careful design consideration around:
1. How versions are stored and retrieved efficiently
2. Integration with the existing pipeline system
3. User interface for version management
4. Migration strategy for existing prompts

## Job Analytics Dashboard

**Added**: Sprint 11  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Complexity**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 sprints  

### Description
Complete implementation of the Job Analytics Dashboard with meaningful performance metrics, trends, and optimization recommendations. Currently shows skeleton loaders and doesn't provide actionable insights.

### Current State
- Basic component structure exists but data loading is incomplete
- Analytics API exists but doesn't return job-specific meaningful data
- UI shows charts and metrics but values are mostly placeholder/empty
- User experience is confusing with permanent loading states

### Technical Considerations
- **Data Aggregation**: Need proper job performance metrics calculation
- **Real Analytics**: Meaningful insights about job execution patterns, bottlenecks, stage performance
- **Visualization**: Charts and graphs that actually help users understand job performance
- **Optimization Recommendations**: Actionable suggestions for improving pipeline efficiency
- **Historical Trends**: Track job performance over time for pattern analysis
- **Cost Analysis**: Include execution time, resource usage, and cost implications

### User Stories
- As a pipeline manager, I want to see which stages take the longest to optimize my pipeline
- As an analyst, I want to understand job success patterns to improve prompt effectiveness  
- As an admin, I want to track system performance and identify bottlenecks
- As a user, I want recommendations on how to improve my job configurations

### Implementation Requirements
1. Design meaningful analytics data model and database schema
2. Implement proper data aggregation and calculation logic
3. Create interactive charts with real performance data
4. Build optimization recommendation engine
5. Add export functionality for analytics reports
6. Implement historical trend tracking
7. Add cost and resource usage analysis

### Dependencies
- Job execution system (✅ completed)
- Job monitoring system (✅ completed) 
- Database optimization for analytics queries
- Charting library integration (Recharts - ✅ available)

### Notes
- Currently hidden behind feature flag until proper implementation
- Should focus on actionable insights rather than just displaying data
- Consider user personas and what analytics would actually be valuable
