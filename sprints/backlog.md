## Prompt Versioning System

**Added**: Sprint 8  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Complexity**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 sprints  

### Description
Implement a comprehensive versioning system for prompts that allows users to:
- Track changes to prompts over time
- Revert to previous versions
- Compare different versions
- Maintain audit trails for prompt evolution

### Technical Considerations
- **Database Schema**: Need to design version storage (separate table vs. JSON history)
- **UI/UX Design**: Version comparison interface, rollback workflows, version navigation
- **Performance**: How to handle large version histories efficiently
- **Storage**: Optimization for storing multiple versions without excessive storage growth
- **Permissions**: Who can create versions, rollback, etc.
- **Pipeline Impact**: How versioning affects existing pipelines using those prompts

### User Stories
- As a prompt creator, I want to see the history of changes I've made to a prompt
- As a manager, I want to rollback a prompt to a previous version if the current one isn't working
- As an analyst, I want to compare two versions of a prompt to understand what changed
- As an admin, I want to see who made changes and when for audit purposes

### Dependencies
- Prompt management system (✅ completed in Sprint 8)
- User permission system (✅ available)
- Pipeline system integration (✅ completed in Sprint 8)

### Notes
This feature requires careful design consideration around:
1. How versions are stored and retrieved efficiently
2. Integration with the existing pipeline system
3. User interface for version management
4. Migration strategy for existing prompts
