## Prompt Edit/Delete Functionality

**Added**: Sprint 8  
**Priority**: High  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 0.5-1 sprint  

### Description
Implement comprehensive edit and delete functionality for prompts with proper permissions and safety checks:
- Edit prompt name, content, and type
- Delete prompts with dependency checking
- Permission-based access control
- Toast notifications using Sonner
- Real-time list refresh after operations

### Technical Considerations

2. Create prompt edit form (reuse/extend existing PromptForm)
3. Implement PUT endpoint for prompt updates
4. Implement DELETE endpoint with dependency checking
5. Add refresh mechanism to PromptList component
6. Integrate Sonner toast notifications
7. Add permission checks in UI and API

## Prompt Versioning System

**Added**: Sprint 8  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Complexity**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 sprints  

### Description
Implement a comprehensive versioning system for prompts that allows users to:
- Track changes to prompts over time
- Revert to previous versions
- Compare different versions
- Maintain audit trails for prompt evolution

### Technical Considerations
- **Database Schema**: Need to design version storage (separate table vs. JSON history)
- **UI/UX Design**: Version comparison interface, rollback workflows, version navigation
- **Performance**: How to handle large version histories efficiently
- **Storage**: Optimization for storing multiple versions without excessive storage growth
- **Permissions**: Who can create versions, rollback, etc.
- **Pipeline Impact**: How versioning affects existing pipelines using those prompts

### User Stories
- As a prompt creator, I want to see the history of changes I've made to a prompt
- As a manager, I want to rollback a prompt to a previous version if the current one isn't working
- As an analyst, I want to compare two versions of a prompt to understand what changed
- As an admin, I want to see who made changes and when for audit purposes

### Dependencies
- Prompt management system (✅ completed in Sprint 8)
- User permission system (✅ available)
- Pipeline system integration (✅ completed in Sprint 8)

### Notes
This feature requires careful design consideration around:
1. How versions are stored and retrieved efficiently
2. Integration with the existing pipeline system
3. User interface for version management
4. Migration strategy for existing prompts

**Complexity**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 sprints  

### Description
Extend the current global feature flag system to support user-specific and group-specific overrides, allowing fine-grained control over feature availability for different users and groups.

### Current State
- Global feature flag system fully implemented and working well
- FeatureFlagManager provides excellent UX for managing global flags
- Feature flags integrated throughout codebase with `useFeatureFlag` hook
- 5-minute caching mechanism with manual refresh capability
- Comprehensive audit logging and notifications

### Technical Considerations

### Required Database Schema
```sql
-- User-specific feature flag overrides
CREATE TABLE user_feature_flags (
    id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    feature_flag_id UUID REFERENCES feature_flags(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    enabled BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(user_id, feature_flag_id)
);

-- Group-specific feature flag overrides  
CREATE TABLE group_feature_flags (
    id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
    group_id UUID REFERENCES groups(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    feature_flag_id UUID REFERENCES feature_flags(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    enabled BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    priority INTEGER DEFAULT 0,  -- For handling multiple group memberships
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(group_id, feature_flag_id)
);
```

### User Stories
- As an admin, I want to enable experimental features for specific beta users
- As an admin, I want to disable problematic features for specific groups while keeping them enabled globally
- As a group manager, I want to control which features my team members can access
- As a user, I want to understand which features are available to me based on my group memberships
- As an admin, I want to see which users/groups have overrides for specific features

### Implementation Requirements
1. Design and implement new database tables with proper indexes and RLS policies
2. Update feature flag resolution logic to check user > group > global hierarchy
3. Extend FeatureFlagManager UI to show and manage overrides
4. Add override management to UserDetailsDialog and GroupsPanel
5. Create new API endpoints for managing user/group overrides
6. Update `featureFlags.ts` library to handle personalized lookups
7. Modify caching strategy to support user-specific cache keys
8. Add visual indicators in admin UI showing override status
