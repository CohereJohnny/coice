### Library Management
- [x] Create library creation form with parent library selection
- [ ] Implement library hierarchy display (tree structure)
- [x] Add library editing capabilities
- [ ] Implement library deletion with cascade handling
- [ ] Build library navigation in sidebar

### Sidebar Navigation Enhancement
- [ ] Extend sidebar to show catalog/library hierarchy
- [ ] Add expandable/collapsible catalog sections
- [ ] Implement library tree navigation with icons
- [ ] Add context menus for catalog/library actions
- [ ] Show user's accessible catalogs based on role

### Permission System

- [ ] Implement catalog access restrictions

### Admin Panel Foundation
- [ ] Create basic admin panel layout
- [ ] Add user management interface (list users)
- [ ] Implement user role assignment functionality
- [ ] Add user creation form for admins
- [ ] Create user editing and deletion capabilities

### UI/UX Enhancements
- [x] Design and implement catalog/library cards
- [x] Add loading states for catalog/library operations
- [x] Implement error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- [ ] Create breadcrumb navigation for library hierarchy

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test catalog CRUD operations across all roles
- [ ] Verify library hierarchy creation and navigation
- [ ] Test permission restrictions for different user roles
- [ ] Validate admin panel functionality
- [ ] Test responsive design for catalog/library interfaces

## Progress Notes

### Database & API Foundation - COMPLETED
- ✅ Reviewed existing database schema - all tables (catalogs, libraries) are properly set up with RLS policies
- ✅ Created comprehensive catalog API routes:
  - GET /api/catalogs - List user's accessible catalogs
  - POST /api/catalogs - Create new catalog (Manager/Admin only)
  - GET /api/catalogs/[id] - Get specific catalog
  - PUT /api/catalogs/[id] - Update catalog
  - DELETE /api/catalogs/[id] - Delete catalog (with dependency checks)
- ✅ Created comprehensive library API routes:
  - GET /api/libraries - List libraries with hierarchy support
  - POST /api/libraries - Create new library with parent-child relationships
  - GET /api/libraries/[id] - Get specific library
  - PUT /api/libraries/[id] - Update library (with circular reference prevention)
  - DELETE /api/libraries/[id] - Delete library (with cascade checks)
- ✅ Implemented role-based permissions using existing RLS policies
- ✅ Added comprehensive validation for all operations including duplicate name checks and hierarchy validation

### UI Components - MOSTLY COMPLETED
- ✅ Created CatalogForm component with validation and error handling
- ✅ Created LibraryForm component with parent selection and catalog filtering
- ✅ Created CatalogList component with action menus and permission-based controls
- ✅ Added Textarea and Badge UI components to support forms
- ✅ Implemented loading states and responsive design
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript interfaces and error handling
