## Progress Notes

### Database & API Foundation - COMPLETED
- ✅ Reviewed existing database schema - all tables (catalogs, libraries) are properly set up with RLS policies
- ✅ Created comprehensive catalog API routes:
  - GET /api/catalogs - List user's accessible catalogs

  - DELETE /api/catalogs/[id] - Delete catalog (with dependency checks)
- ✅ Created comprehensive library API routes:
  - GET /api/libraries - List libraries with hierarchy support
  - POST /api/libraries - Create new library with parent-child relationships
  - GET /api/libraries/[id] - Get specific library
  - PUT /api/libraries/[id] - Update library (with circular reference prevention)
  - DELETE /api/libraries/[id] - Delete library (with cascade checks)
- ✅ Implemented role-based permissions using existing RLS policies
- ✅ Added comprehensive validation for all operations including duplicate name checks and hierarchy validation

### UI Components - COMPLETED
