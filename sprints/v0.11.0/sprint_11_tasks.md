## Tasks

### Core Job Processing Enhancement
- [x] **Task 1.1**: Complete multi-stage pipeline processing logic
  - [x] Enhance job worker to handle sequential stage execution
  - [x] Implement stage dependency resolution
  - [x] Add conditional stage execution based on previous results
  - [x] Handle stage failures and retry logic

  **Progress**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Enhanced ImageProcessor with comprehensive multi-stage pipeline processing. Added sequential stage execution with proper dependency resolution, conditional filtering for boolean prompts, execution time tracking, and robust error handling with partial result preservation.

- [x] **Task 1.2**: Implement comprehensive job result storage
  - [x] Create job_results table insertion logic
  - [x] Store stage-specific results with metadata
  - [x] Implement result versioning and history
  - [x] Add result compression for large datasets

  **Progress**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Enhanced job result storage with comprehensive versioning, history tracking, and compression features. Added version field to job_results table, created job_result_history table for audit trail, implemented automatic compression for results >50KB with smart truncation, added bulk storage optimization for large datasets, and created database triggers for automatic versioning. Results now support full history tracking and efficient storage of large datasets.

- [x] **Task 1.3**: Enhance job status and progress tracking
  - [x] Update job status for each stage completion
  - [x] Track detailed progress within stages
  - [x] Implement stage-level error reporting
  - [x] Add execution time tracking per stage

  **Progress**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Created comprehensive JobMonitoringService with real-time progress tracking, stage-level monitoring, and detailed analytics. Applied database migrations for enhanced progress tracking tables (job_progress, stage_progress_history, stage_errors). Integrated monitoring service into ImageProcessor for automated progress updates, error reporting, and metrics collection. Added API endpoints /api/jobs/[id]/progress and /api/jobs/[id]/metrics for accessing monitoring data. Service includes real-time subscriptions, execution metrics calculation, progress history analytics, and automatic cleanup functions.

### Results Storage & Retrieval System
- [x] **Task 2.1**: Build job result storage service
  - [x] Create JobResultService for CRUD operations
  - [x] Implement efficient result retrieval with pagination
  - [x] Add result filtering by stage, criteria, and metadata
  - [x] Optimize database queries for large result sets

  **Progress**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Created comprehensive JobResultService with advanced filtering, pagination, aggregation, and statistics. Implemented full CRUD operations, export functionality (CSV/JSON/Excel), full-text search, and RESTful API endpoints (/api/job-results/ and /api/job-results/[id]/). Service supports complex filtering by job, image, stage, success status, confidence levels, dates, search terms, errors, and execution times.

- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Implement result indexing and search
  - Create search indices for result content
  - Implement full-text search across results
  - Add metadata-based filtering capabilities
  - Build result aggregation and statistics

- [ ] **Task 2.3**: Add result export functionality
  - Export results to CSV, JSON, and Excel formats
  - Support filtered and paginated exports
  - Include metadata and stage information in exports
  - Add bulk export for multiple jobs

### Results Viewing Interface
- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Build results viewing components
  - Create JobResultsView component with Card/List/Carousel views
  - Implement results filtering and sorting interface
  - Add stage-specific result display components
  - Build result detail modal with full metadata

- [ ] **Task 3.2**: Implement advanced filtering system
  - Create filter sidebar for results
  - Add date range, stage, and criteria filters
  - Implement tag-based filtering
  - Add saved filter presets

- [ ] **Task 3.3**: Build result comparison interface
  - Create side-by-side job comparison view
  - Implement diff highlighting for result changes
  - Add comparison metrics and statistics
  - Build comparison export functionality

### Job Analysis & Insights
- [ ] **Task 4.1**: Create job analytics dashboard
  - Build performance metrics visualization
  - Add success/failure rate tracking
  - Implement stage execution time analysis
  - Create job efficiency recommendations

- [ ] **Task 4.2**: Implement job comparison tools
  - Create job performance comparison charts
  - Add prompt effectiveness analysis
  - Build pipeline optimization suggestions
  - Implement A/B testing framework for prompts

- [ ] **Task 4.3**: Add result validation and quality checks
  - Implement result consistency validation
  - Add quality scoring for AI responses
  - Create confidence metrics display
  - Build result review and approval workflow

### API & Integration Enhancements
- [ ] **Task 5.1**: Enhance job management APIs
  - Add result retrieval endpoints with filtering
  - Implement job comparison API endpoints
  - Add analytics and metrics endpoints
  - Create bulk operations for job management

- [ ] **Task 5.2**: Optimize performance for large datasets
