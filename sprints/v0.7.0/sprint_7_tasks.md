# Sprint 7 Tasks

## Goals
Implement Carousel view for full-screen image browsing with advanced touch gestures, slideshow functionality, and comprehensive state management.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURAL DECISION: Component Refactoring**
The original Carousel.tsx grew to 1800+ lines, violating maintainability principles. We're implementing a component composition architecture for better:
- Maintainability and debugging
- Testability (individual component testing)
- Code reuse and readability
- Team collaboration
- Performance optimization

## Refactored Architecture

### **New Component Structure:**
1. **`Carousel.tsx`** (Main container - ~150 lines) - Core coordination
2. **`CarouselImage.tsx`** (~200 lines) - Image display & zoom/pan
3. **`CarouselNavigation.tsx`** (~200 lines) - Arrow controls & thumbnails
4. **`CarouselControls.tsx`** (~150 lines) - Top bar controls & slideshow
5. **`CarouselMetadata.tsx`** (~200 lines) - Metadata overlay
6. **`CarouselTouchHandler.tsx`** (~250 lines) - Touch gesture logic

### **Custom Hooks:**
7. **`useCarouselState.ts`** (~150 lines) - State management & URL persistence
8. **`useCarouselKeyboard.ts`** (~100 lines) - Keyboard navigation
9. **`useCarouselAnalytics.ts`** (~100 lines) - Analytics tracking
10. **`useCarouselPerformance.ts`** (~150 lines) - Performance monitoring
