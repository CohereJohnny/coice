### Technical Considerations
- **Embla Carousel**: Using embla-carousel-react for robust carousel functionality
- **Performance**: Implementing preloading and virtual scrolling for large image sets
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Mobile**: Touch/swipe gestures with momentum and pinch-to-zoom
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Card/List views

### Success Criteria
- Smooth full-screen image browsing experience
- Professional navigation controls and animations
- Comprehensive keyboard and touch support
- Metadata overlay with toggle functionality
- Slideshow mode with customizable settings
- Mobile-optimized touch interactions
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Dependencies
