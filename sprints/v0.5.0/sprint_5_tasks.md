## Progress Notes

### Phase 1 Progress:
- âœ… Created comprehensive GCS client utility (`lib/gcs.ts`) with upload, delete, signed URL generation, and file management functions
- âœ… Environment variables already configured in `.env.example` for GCS integration
- âœ… Implemented connection testing and bucket metadata retrieval
- âœ… Set up hierarchical storage structure: `catalogs/<catalog_id>/<library_id>/<filename>`

### Phase 2 Progress:
- âœ… Built image upload API route (`/api/images/upload`) with authentication, validation, and permission checks
- âœ… Created comprehensive image utilities (`lib/image-utils.ts`) for validation, EXIF extraction, and file processing
- âœ… Implemented drag-and-drop ImageUpload component with progress tracking, error handling, and batch upload support
- âœ… Added Progress UI component for visual upload progress indication
- âœ… Supports multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, BMP, TIFF) with 50MB file size limit

### Phase 3 Progress:
- âœ… Implemented GCS storage structure with catalog/library organization
- âœ… Added EXIF metadata extraction with comprehensive tag support (camera info, GPS, technical details)
- âœ… Database integration stores image records with GCS paths and metadata
- âœ… Implemented server-side thumbnail generation using Sharp with multiple sizes (150px, 300px, 600px)
- âœ… Added automatic thumbnail upload to GCS with organized storage structure
- âœ… Enhanced metadata extraction with Sharp for accurate image dimensions and technical details

### Phase 4 Progress:
- âœ… Created image listing API (`/api/images`) with pagination, authentication, and signed URL generation
- âœ… Implemented GCS file listing with proper access control
- âœ… Built image deletion API (`/api/images/[id]`) with GCS cleanup and permission validation
- âœ… Added image download functionality with signed URLs and proper file naming
- âœ… Implemented role-based access control (Manager/Admin can delete, all roles can view/download)

### Phase 5 Progress:
- âœ… Created comprehensive LibraryDetailClient component with full image management UI
- âœ… Integrated ImageUpload component with library detail pages
- âœ… Implemented grid and list view modes for image display
- âœ… Added pagination for handling large image collections (20 images per page)
- âœ… Built image preview, metadata display, and batch operations
- âœ… Added proper loading states, error handling, and user feedback throughout
- âœ… Implemented download functionality with proper file naming
- âœ… Added delete confirmation dialogs and success/error notifications
