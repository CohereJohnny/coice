const hasAccess = 
  catalog.user_id === user.id ||                    // User owns catalog
  profile?.role === 'admin' || profile?.role === 'manager' || // Admin/Manager role
  accessibleCatalogIds.includes(catalog.id);       // Group-based access
```

#### **Database Relationships Working:**
- âœ… `users` â†’ `user_groups` â†’ `groups` â†’ `catalog_groups` â†’ `catalogs`
- âœ… Group-based access control fully functional
