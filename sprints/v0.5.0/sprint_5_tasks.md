# Sprint 5 Tasks

## Goals
Integrate Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for image storage, implement upload functionality with drag-and-drop, and establish basic image management capabilities.

## Key Deliverables
- GCS service account setup and authentication
- Image upload functionality with drag-and-drop
- GCS bucket listing and navigation
- Image metadata extraction (EXIF)
- Basic image storage and retrieval

## Tasks

### Phase 1: GCS Setup & Configuration
- [x] Set up GCS service account and credentials
- [x] Configure GCS client in the application
- [x] Create environment variables for GCS configuration
- [x] Test GCS connection and authentication
- [x] Set up bucket structure for catalogs and libraries

### Phase 2: Image Upload Infrastructure
- [x] Create image upload API routes
- [x] Implement drag-and-drop upload component
- [x] Add image validation (size, type, format)
- [x] Create upload progress indicators
- [x] Implement error handling for upload failures
- [x] Add batch upload support for multiple images

### Phase 3: Image Storage & Organization
- [x] Implement GCS storage structure (catalogs/<id>/<library_id>/)
- [x] Create image metadata extraction using exif-js
- [x] Store image records in database with GCS paths
- [ ] Implement image thumbnail generation
- [ ] Add image versioning and conflict resolution

### Phase 4: Image Retrieval & Management
- [x] Create image listing API for libraries
- [x] Implement GCS bucket listing functionality
- [ ] Add image preview and download capabilities
- [ ] Create image deletion functionality
- [ ] Implement image search within libraries

### Phase 5: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Integrate upload functionality with library management
- [ ] Add upload UI to library detail pages
- [ ] Test upload/download performance with various image sizes
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Add loading states for all image operations

## Progress Notes

### Phase 1 Progress:
- âœ… Created comprehensive GCS client utility (`lib/gcs.ts`) with upload, delete, signed URL generation, and file management functions
- âœ… Environment variables already configured in `.env.example` for GCS integration
- âœ… Implemented connection testing and bucket metadata retrieval
- âœ… Set up hierarchical storage structure: `catalogs/<catalog_id>/<library_id>/<filename>`

### Phase 2 Progress:
- âœ… Built image upload API route (`/api/images/upload`) with authentication, validation, and permission checks
- âœ… Created comprehensive image utilities (`lib/image-utils.ts`) for validation, EXIF extraction, and file processing
- âœ… Implemented drag-and-drop ImageUpload component with progress tracking, error handling, and batch upload support
- âœ… Added Progress UI component for visual upload progress indication
- âœ… Supports multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, BMP, TIFF) with 50MB file size limit

### Phase 3 Progress:
- âœ… Implemented GCS storage structure with catalog/library organization
- âœ… Added EXIF metadata extraction with comprehensive tag support (camera info, GPS, technical details)
- âœ… Database integration stores image records with GCS paths and metadata
- ðŸ”„ Next: Thumbnail generation and conflict resolution

### Phase 4 Progress:
- âœ… Created image listing API (`/api/images`) with pagination, authentication, and signed URL generation
- âœ… Implemented GCS file listing with proper access control
- ðŸ”„ Next: Preview capabilities, deletion functionality, and search features

### Phase 5 Progress:
- ðŸ”„ Ready to integrate upload component with library detail pages
- ðŸ”„ Need to add comprehensive testing and performance optimization
