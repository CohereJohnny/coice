### Phase 3: Job Processing Implementation
- [x] Build job processing worker functions
  - [x] Create main job processing worker
  - [x] Implement stage-based pipeline processing
  - [x] Add image analysis with Cohere V2 API
  - [x] Create job result storage logic
  - [x] Implement stage progression and conditional filtering
  - [x] Fix database schema alignment for job_results table
  - [x] Update ImageProcessor to use correct JSONB result structure

  **Progress**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - ImageProcessor worker class fully implemented with multi-stage pipeline execution, progress tracking, and database updates. Fixed critical database schema mismatch - job_results now properly stores all metadata in JSONB result field. Stage filtering logic working correctly. Real Cohere API integration functional for all prompt types.

- [x] Add job status tracking and updates
  - [x] Implement real-time job status updates in database
  - [x] Create job progress calculation logic
  - [x] Add stage completion tracking
  - [x] Implement job error state handling
  - [x] Add job cancellation functionality

  **Progress**: Progress tracking implemented using Bull queue progress and database updates. Job status updates include error handling and completion tracking. Created database migration to add missing fields (error_message, results_summary, updated_at).

### Phase 4: Error Handling & Reliability
- [x] Implement error handling and retry logic
  - [x] Add comprehensive error handling for Cohere API calls
  - [x] Implement exponential backoff retry logic
  - [x] Create error classification (retryable vs non-retryable)
  - [x] Add job failure recovery mechanisms
  - [x] Implement dead letter queue for failed jobs

  **Progress**: Comprehensive error handling throughout the system. CohereService includes retry logic with exponential backoff and error classification. Queue system handles failed jobs with retry mechanisms. ImageProcessor includes graceful error handling for individual image processing failures.

### Phase 5: User Interface Components
- [x] Create job submission interface
  - [x] Build job submission form component
  - [x] Add pipeline selection for job submission
  - [x] Implement image selection for analysis
  - [x] Create job submission confirmation
  - [x] Add job submission success/error feedback

  **Progress**: Created comprehensive JobSubmissionForm component with pipeline/library selection, image selection with bulk operations, form validation, and user feedback. Component supports pre-population and callbacks for integration.

- [x] Add basic job monitoring dashboard
  - [x] Create job status overview component
  - [x] Build job progress display with percentage
  - [x] Add job history listing
  - [x] Implement job details view
  - [x] Create job action buttons (cancel, retry)

  **Progress**: Implemented JobMonitoringDashboard with real-time job status display, progress tracking, job cancellation, detailed job view with modal, and auto-refresh functionality. Added date-fns dependency for time formatting.

### Phase 6: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Integration testing and validation
  - [ ] Test end-to-end job submission and processing
  - [ ] Validate Cohere API integration with real images
  - [ ] Test error scenarios and recovery
  - [ ] Verify job queue performance under load

  - [ ] Document job processing workflow
  - [ ] Add API documentation for job endpoints
  - [ ] Create configuration guide for Cohere setup
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Technical Implementation Notes
