# Sprint 9 Tasks

## Goals
Integrate Cohere V2 API, implement job submission system, and basic job processing

## Key Deliverables
- Cohere V2 Client integration
- Job submission and queuing system
- Basic job processing workflow
- Job status tracking
- Error handling for AI API calls

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Cohere V2 Integration Setup
- [x] Set up Cohere V2 Client and API authentication
  - [x] Install cohere-ai package
  - [x] Configure environment variables for Cohere API key
  - [x] Create Cohere V2 client service
  - [x] Implement authentication and connection testing
  - [x] Add error handling for API connection issues
  
  **Progress**: Completed CohereService class with placeholder image analysis system. Due to TypeScript client limitations with multimodal API, implemented placeholder responses for testing. Service includes retry logic, exponential backoff, error classification, and singleton pattern.

### Phase 2: Job System Foundation
- [x] Implement job submission API routes
  - [x] Create `/api/jobs/submit` endpoint
  - [x] Create `/api/jobs/[id]` endpoint for job details
  - [x] Create `/api/jobs/history` endpoint for job listing
  - [x] Add input validation for job submission
  - [x] Implement job creation in database

  **Progress**: All API endpoints implemented with comprehensive validation using Zod. Job submission includes pipeline/library/image validation and proper error handling. Job details endpoint provides real-time progress tracking. History endpoint supports pagination and filtering.

- [x] Create Bull queue system for job processing
  - [x] Install Bull and Redis dependencies
  - [x] Configure Redis connection for job queue
  - [x] Set up Bull queue with proper configuration
  - [x] Create job queue worker setup
  - [x] Add queue monitoring and health checks

  **Progress**: Complete QueueService implementation with Bull/Redis integration. Includes job management (add/get/cancel/retry), statistics monitoring, event handlers, health checks, and cleanup functionality.

### Phase 3: Job Processing Implementation
- [x] Build job processing worker functions
  - [x] Create main job processing worker
  - [x] Implement stage-based pipeline processing
  - [x] Add image analysis with Cohere V2 API
  - [x] Create job result storage logic
  - [x] Implement stage progression and conditional filtering

  **Progress**: Implemented ImageProcessor worker class with multi-stage pipeline execution, progress tracking, database updates, and stage filtering logic. Fixed database schema issues and added missing fields to jobs table.

- [x] Add job status tracking and updates
  - [x] Implement real-time job status updates in database
  - [x] Create job progress calculation logic
  - [x] Add stage completion tracking
  - [x] Implement job error state handling
  - [x] Add job cancellation functionality

  **Progress**: Progress tracking implemented using Bull queue progress and database updates. Job status updates include error handling and completion tracking. Created database migration to add missing fields (error_message, results_summary, updated_at).

### Phase 4: Error Handling & Reliability
- [x] Implement error handling and retry logic
  - [x] Add comprehensive error handling for Cohere API calls
  - [x] Implement exponential backoff retry logic
  - [x] Create error classification (retryable vs non-retryable)
  - [x] Add job failure recovery mechanisms
  - [x] Implement dead letter queue for failed jobs

  **Progress**: Comprehensive error handling throughout the system. CohereService includes retry logic with exponential backoff and error classification. Queue system handles failed jobs with retry mechanisms. ImageProcessor includes graceful error handling for individual image processing failures.

### Phase 5: User Interface Components
- [x] Create job submission interface
  - [x] Build job submission form component
  - [x] Add pipeline selection for job submission
  - [x] Implement image selection for analysis
  - [x] Create job submission confirmation
  - [x] Add job submission success/error feedback

  **Progress**: Created comprehensive JobSubmissionForm component with pipeline/library selection, image selection with bulk operations, form validation, and user feedback. Component supports pre-population and callbacks for integration.

- [x] Add basic job monitoring dashboard
  - [x] Create job status overview component
  - [x] Build job progress display with percentage
  - [x] Add job history listing
  - [x] Implement job details view
  - [x] Create job action buttons (cancel, retry)

  **Progress**: Implemented JobMonitoringDashboard with real-time job status display, progress tracking, job cancellation, detailed job view with modal, and auto-refresh functionality. Added date-fns dependency for time formatting.

### Phase 6: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Integration testing and validation
  - [ ] Test end-to-end job submission and processing
  - [ ] Validate Cohere API integration with real images
  - [ ] Test error scenarios and recovery
  - [ ] Verify job queue performance under load
  - [ ] Test job cancellation and cleanup

- [ ] Documentation and cleanup
  - [ ] Document job processing workflow
  - [ ] Add API documentation for job endpoints
  - [ ] Create configuration guide for Cohere setup
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Cohere V2 Integration
- Use the latest cohere-ai npm package
- Implement proper API key management
- Add rate limiting awareness
- Support for multiple model types (if needed)

### Job Queue Architecture
- Use Bull with Redis for reliable job processing
- Implement proper job priorities
- Add job retry logic with exponential backoff
- Support for job cancellation and cleanup

### Database Schema
- Leverage existing jobs, job_results, and job_progress tables
- Ensure proper foreign key relationships
- Add indexes for performance optimization

### Error Handling Strategy
- Classify errors as retryable vs permanent
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for API calls
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging
- Provide meaningful error messages to users

## Dependencies
- cohere-ai package for Cohere V2 API
- bull and ioredis for job queue system
- Redis instance (can be local for development)
- Existing pipeline and prompt management system

## Success Criteria
- Successfully submit jobs through the UI
